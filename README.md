## About the Project

Carrefour is a French group, and a leading global retailer.  Their main asset is staying as close as possible to their customers in the various countries and territories in which they operate, they continuously adapt our retail formats and channels to suit their needs.

As a Data analyst at Carrefour Kenya and currently undertaking a project that will inform the marketing department on the most relevant marketing strategies that will result in the hughest number of sales (total price including tax). I'll explore a recent marketing dataset by performing various unsupervised learning techniques and later providing recommendations based on your insights. 

Exploration of the recent existing marketing dataset will be done in four parts

### Part 1 & 2 : Dimensinality Reduction and Feature selection
Dimensionality reduction entails reducing the dataset to a low dimensional dataset using the t-SNW algorithm or PCA. Feature selection requires using unsupervised learning methods.

### Part 3 : Association Rules
Association rules allow the team identify relationships between the variables in the dataset.

### Part 4 : Anomaly detection
Help us check whether there are any anomalies in the dataset
